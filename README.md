# Missing Return Statement Error in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a page component is missing a `return` statement, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

## Problem

The `about.js` file lacks a `return` statement within the `About` component.  Next.js requires that page components explicitly return the JSX to be rendered.  Without it, Next.js will not know what to display and may throw an error.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the `about.js` component, including the necessary `return` statement.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You should see an error if you're using the original `about.js` and the corrected output if using `aboutSolution.js`.
